### Disclaimer
If all that you want to do is apply this model to a dataset and measure its
 performance, you will find the code to be bulky in that it stores parameters,
 variables, and data that do not need to be saved. This code was written for
 an Explainable Artificial Intelligence project in mind, whose objective is
 model explainability (not necessarily speed or performance).

### k-Folds Cross-validation on the Google_Faces Emotions Dataset
K-folds on facial recognition (where classes are specific people), traditionally
 gets about 40-60% accuracy. Here, we are trying to do emotion classification
 based on very little and uncontrolled data (23-86 samples of DIFFERENT faces    for each of the 7 emotions) and are finding around 30% accuracy, which is bad,
 but also above chance level.

python3.5 cross_validation_PLDA.py
```

### Testing (Requres decent computing power. I had access to ~ 60ish CPU cores)
cd to the directory containing the respository, the 'PLDA.py' file in particular.
```
cd /Documents/folder/path/to/probabilistic_LDA/
```

To run all tests:
```
python3.5 -m unittest discover
```

To run one of the three tests in the tests folder, use one of the following lines:
```
python3.5 -m unittest tests/test_inference_PLDA.py
python3.5 -m unittest tests/test_integration_PLDA.py
python3.5 -m unittest tests/test_units_PLDA.py
```
