__Disclaimers__

1. Parameters are estimated via empirical Bayes.
2. I wrote this code while working on an Explainable Artificial Intelligence 
    (XAI) project at the 
    [CoDaS Laboratory](http://shaftolab.com/people.html), 
    so it keeps parameters in memory that are unnecessary for simple 
    classification problems.
   It's intended to be readable to researchers.

__Thanks__!

 [@matiaslindgren](https://github.com/matiaslindgren) pushed for and 
 implemented the same-different discrimination and the pip install, 
 respectively!

## Demo with MNIST Handwritten Digits Data

If you installed this package in a virtual environment, 
 remember to activate that virtual environment first.
Link: [mnist_demo/mnist_demo.ipynb](./mnist_demo/mnist_demo.ipynb).

## Testing the software

See [tests/README.md](./tests/README.md).

## Installation

If you are new to programming, research, or sharing remote machines, 
 you will save yourself a lot of headache by installing the following software:
 [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and 
 [`conda`](https://github.com/conda/conda).
You may install this package by using `pip install` or by adding a few lines 
 to your own environment.yml file.

__Installing with `pip install`__

1. `cd` into your favorite directory.
2. `git clone https://github.com/RaviSoji/plda.git`
3. If you have one, activate your virtual environment.
   E.g. `conda activate myenv`.
   If you installed `conda`, you can make one called `myenv` by running 
    `conda env create -f plda/environment.yml -n myenv`. 
4. Run either `pip install plda/` or `pip install ./plda`.

__Installing using your own conda environment.yml file.__

1. Add the following to the end of your dependencies.
   Here is an example: [environment.yml](./environment.yml).
  ```
  - python>=3.5
  - numpy~=1.14.2
  - scipy~=1.0.1
  - scikit-learn~=0.19.1
  - pip=20.2.1
  - pip:
    - git+git://github.com/RaviSoji/plda@master
  ```
